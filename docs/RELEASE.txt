New releases
============

When doing new releases of the module, check the following:

* Version number
    * Always change the version number when doing a new release of the module
        * PrestaShop does not require any specific versioning scheme, but it is recommended to use one, e.g.
        Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/)
    * The version number is located in two files, but you need only update one
        * Change the version number in file nostotagging.php,which is the main module file and the version number can
        be found in the NostoTagging class constructor
        * The version number can also be found in config.xml, but this is updated automatically by PrestaShop after
        changing the version number in nostotagging.php and reloading a page in the PrestaShop installation where
        the module is installed

When the module is ready to be released, create a zip archive of the entire "nostotagging" directory from the
repository and name it "nostotagging.zip".

The archive can then be uploaded to the PrestaShop market place (http://addons.prestashop.com) through your sellers
account.
